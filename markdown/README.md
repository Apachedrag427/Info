Intro
==========
Hello there!  I am Apache.
- I am a guy
- I'm a demotivated programmer
- I like games

I mostly script for Roblox, but I'm currently learning C++ and trying to expand my programming knowledge among all languages.

I find great pleasure in writing pointless libraries that I will likely never use.  I also *love* reinventing the wheel, and try to avoid using others' code when I can.  I prefer using my own code, because creating what I need myself (maybe using a little *inspiration ;)*) is a great learning experience for me.

When I'm not programming, I'm either gaming or hanging out with some of the interesting people I've met.  One of my passions is meeting all sorts of people from all over the world!
