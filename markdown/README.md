Intro
=============
Hello there!  I am Apache.  I enjoy programming and playing games.  I struggle with motivation.

I mostly script for Roblox, but I'm currently learning C++ and trying to expand my programming knowledge.

I find great pleasure in writing pointless libraries that I will likely never use.  I also *love* reinventing the 
wheel, and try to avoid using others' code when I can.  I prefer using my own code, because creating what I need 
myself (maybe using a little *inspiration ;)*) is a great learning experience for me.
