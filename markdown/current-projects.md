# My Projects

This is a list of some projects that I've been working on.  I will add to this over time.

## Unexpected Arrival [Not a focus]
Unexpected Arrival is a WIP Roblox single-player shooter game.  I am currently the sole developer.  Progress is very slow, and it's a very ambitious project.  There is no planned release date, or really any deadlines.  I work on it for fun.

## Unnamed Game [Not a focus]
A Roblox game I am working on with a friend.  Not much info so far, but think, like, a mix between [Plane Crazy](https://www.roblox.com/games/166986752/Plane-Crazy) and [town debug](https://www.roblox.com/games/6652350934/town-debug).

## Uranium [Current main focus]
Uranium is partially an admin system and partially a framework for creating portable scripts.  It is designed to streamline the repetitive parts of making a script.  For example:

- Clientâ†”Server communication
- Structures/objects that recover when changed/destroyed
- Performant effects
- GUI
- Configuration
